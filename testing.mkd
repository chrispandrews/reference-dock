**USB**

* Maintain a transfer rate of at least 30MB/s for a sustained 100MB transfer over USB with no transmission errors
* Measure sustained USB throughput when all USB ports are pushing data over 12 hours
* Using USB debugger, verify the expected USB protocol sequence when plugging/unplugging

**Power**

* Verify available current on each port when all ports draw power
* Verify voltage/current stays within limits at all ports through connect/disconnect cycles
* Verify an Android device attached to center USB port can both act as a USB OTG host and connect to the hub as well as be charged with 5v power.

**Physical**

* Fits into a variety of cup holders
* Robust connection between cup holder piece and top piece
* Secure mechanical fit between iJoeys and K-board, consider yield point and Young's Modulus of desired material
* K-board must be able to go through 100 attach/detach procedures with the cup holder piece with no visible wear
* K-board must be able to go through 100 attach/detach procedures with the iJoey with no visible wear

**Mechanical**

* Designed for injection molding --> Constant wall thickness, appropriate minimum thickness material (0.050" for ABS), draft angles, slide consideration
* Robust attachment and mating features between housing pieces
* Appropriate fit in specified vehicles (Focus, Flex, F-150, Explorer)
