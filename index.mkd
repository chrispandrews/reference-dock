## Design for Manufacturing Optimizations

The close corners created by the walls to support the USB accessories could pose
a problem. Because the plastic narrows to a small chute and then widens, this
could great some plastic gas effects. One suggestion is to remove the octagon
from the center of the Dock. This would mean that the USB accessories are just
supported on either side, but perhaps this would be sufficient.
